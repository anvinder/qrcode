Problem statement: 
	create a script/multuple scripts that can encrypt a given file and create a qr code for it. 
	The user would need a password to read the file/s post scanning the QRcode. 

Here's what the script is intended to do upon completion: 

Read all pdf files in a folder

For each file in folder:
	check if file is encrypted
	If not, encrypt the file. 
	Rename the file and append the file name with  "_encrypted" so for next loop, the script knows this file is already encrypted. 
	
For all encrypted files
	Upload file to cloud/ move them to the fodler where your cloud is picking files from.
	Generate a shared link 
	Append the link to dictionary (key is the file name: value is the shared link)

For each item in dictionary:
	create QR Code 
	Rename QR code to reflect the name of the file
